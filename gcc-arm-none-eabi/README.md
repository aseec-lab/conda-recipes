# Conda Repackaging for Arm GNU Embedded Toolchain

Some simple repackaging of the `arm-none-eabi` tools for linux and mac.

This allows for easy switching between versions of the toolchain through the use of conda environments.

I currently do not have plans to put these on anaconda.org, so you if you would like to use them, you will need to rebuild them or download the tarbells directly from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JbSJz_Tm9Als3D8dmNvOpTXpg7UD0t1S?usp=sharing).
